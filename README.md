# apk tool
installs apks from github release URLS or .txt bundles.

# how to use?
you first need Python. [Python Download](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.2/python-3.13.2-amd64.exe)
I highly recommend you store the script into another folder on your desktop. Mostly because the script downloads into the directory the script is in.
then follow the instructions on screen!

# how do i make bundles?
Create a .txt file in the directory that the script is in that has "Package-Bundle" somewhere in its name.
Next, you have to put github repo links as seperate lines on the txt file

If there is only 1 release that is an apk, it will get downloaded properly. if there isnt, it will fail.

# is this safe?
check the code for urself lmao
(but seriously, if u think this is malicious or malware, look at the code.)
